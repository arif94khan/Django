    <h1>Welcome to Part9: Your Java Script Level One project!</h1>
     <p>For this project you will be building generic website that will
     seem to ask mundane questions to normal users, but you secretly are
   looking for a spy will be able to give specific answers
 you expect. If all questions are answered correctly, you will post a secret message in console for the Spyto react.</p>
 <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her
     Firstname and Lastname</li>
     <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 </li>
     <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimetres tall</li>
     <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter'y'</li>
 </ul>
<p>We are going to leave this project a little more open-minded,
but if you feel like you need more guidance, check out the
solution walkthrough videos! But believe it or not, we have actually
covered everything you need to know to complete this task. I would
suggest you use Javascript to prompt the user for information and set
these variable to check for the four conditions to all be true.
It's up to you what the secret message is!</p>
<p>A spy with the following information should yoy see your secret message.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jose Johnson</li>
  <li>26 years old</li>
  <li>175cm tall</li>
  <li>Pet name is "Sammy"</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts in whatever order you want,
you can even separate asking for first name and then another
prompt for last name</p>

<p>Also remember to switch out the script src to your own.js file! Right now it's connected to part9.js which contains solutions</p>
